description: Prompt for starting a session by speech via activation word
---
The following text is a part of a speech stream where an activation key word activates an agent.
The activation key word is $1. 

The text is: $2

Before the activation keyword the text might be irrelevant. But make sure that it is really 
irrelevant because it could be that the instructions following the activation key word are 
referencing content before the activation key word. The left text which is relevant and give 
that back. Only return this text and nothing else.
